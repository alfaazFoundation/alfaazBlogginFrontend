        Hi, we are Alfaaz Foundation - A community to promote literature.
      </p>
      <p class="section">
        The intent of our team is to make people fall in love with literature. We try to accomplish this by exposing them to great literature and by motivating them to read more.
      </p>

        To promote this feeling to more people we have started a series of events in which we revive the work of some great poets and recite it in our style to the audience along with some interesting trivia related to that poem/shayari.
      </p>
